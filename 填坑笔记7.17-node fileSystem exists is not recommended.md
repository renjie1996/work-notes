# Background
Test whether or not the given path exists by checking with the file system before create a dir
# Exists is not recommended
### Reason

Using fs.exists() to check for the existence of a file before calling fs.open(), fs.readFile() or fs.writeFile() is not recommended.** Doing so introduces a race condition, since other processes may change the file's state between the two calls. **Instead, user code should open/read/write the file directly and handle the error raised if the file does not exist.

> like this

```javascript
fs.exists('myfile', (exists) => {
  if (exists) {
    console.error('myfile already exists');
  } else {
    fs.open('myfile', 'wx', (err, fd) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      writeMyData(fd);
    });
  }
});
```

### Recommended
The "not recommended" examples above check for existence and then use the file; the "recommended" examples are better because they use the file directly and handle the error, if any.

In general, check for the existence of a file only if the file wonâ€™t be used directly, for example when its existence is a signal from another process.

```javasript
fs.open('myfile', 'r', (err, fd) => {
  if (err) {
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      console.error('myfile does not exist');
      return;
    }

    throw err;
  }

  readMyData(fd);
});
```
